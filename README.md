# Prework Study Guide

## Description
This site is an example of how to setup a basic HTML site with CSS and JavaScript files properly linked together. I built this as a template for myself to reference in the future. I learned the full git workflow process and merging different branches together. This feature will allow me to breakdown my code process in the future and stay on track as I learn through this boot camp. 

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
There a multiple sections on this site for setting up a basic website. More sections can be added and current sections can be added to in the future. Currently the sections are  HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Git. To see the Javascript running, please open DevTools-Console to see the output using Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows).
